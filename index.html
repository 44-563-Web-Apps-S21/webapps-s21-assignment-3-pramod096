            My Favourite Activity - Playing Cricket.
        </h3>
        <p>
            Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven 
            players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard <b>(20-metre)</b>
            pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced 
            on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball 
            bowled at the wicket with the bat <b>(and running between the wickets)</b>,
            while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing
            the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket)
            and dismiss each batter <b>(so they are "out")</b>. I like it for the fun we 
            can have while playing it with my friends.
